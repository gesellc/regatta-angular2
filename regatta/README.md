This program is just beginning its development, so don't expect a working version any time soon.

The main goal of this project is to learn about the state of the art development tools and workflows while still producing something useful.

This means especially using the following:

* Distributed version control ([GitHub.com](https://github.com)) [https://github.com/sturmf/regatta-angular](https://github.com/sturmf/regatta-angular)
* Continous integration ([Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org)) [https://travis-ci.org/sturmf/regatta-angular](https://travis-ci.org/sturmf/regatta-angular)
* Test coverage ([Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io)) [https://coveralls.io/github/sturmf/regatta-angular](https://coveralls.io/github/sturmf/regatta-angular)
* Code smells ([Landscape.io](https://landscape.io)) [https://landscape.io/github/sturmf/regatta-angular/](https://landscape.io/github/sturmf/regatta-angular/)
* Style guide checking ([flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8)) this combines [PEP 0008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) and [pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes)
* Planing and issue tracking ([JIRA Software](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)) [https://regatta.atlassian.net](https://regatta.atlassian.net)
* Documentation ([JIRA Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)) [https://regatta.atlassian.net/wiki](https://regatta.atlassian.net/wiki)
